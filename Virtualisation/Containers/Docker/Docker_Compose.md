### Networks

If nothing is specified, docker compose will create it's own network.

You can specifiy you own network in the docker compose, it can either be an already existing one, or be created inside the docker compose.
If that is the case, the network will be removed when you bring the compose down.

```yaml
networks:
  network:
    driver: bridge
    name: networkName
    external: true
```
